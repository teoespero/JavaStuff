Hello Foothill Java Kids!
My name is Teodulfo Espero
My student ID is 20314854

CS 1A, Section 10114 online

Syllabus
--------

Description: 
CS 1A is an introduction to computer programming using the Java language. You
will be learning how to write Java programs that cover a wide range of applications. For
success, however, you will also need both a desire to learn and a positive attitude.

Lab Homework Requirements
-------------------------

Not Running. You will not get any points for a program that doesn't at least
compile and run. If you can't get the program to run, keep trying to debug it, ask for
help, and hand it in late.  On-time non-running = zero.  Late, working = many points.
The correct choice should be obvious.

Doesn't Run to Spec. You will lose many points (from 3 to 10) for a program
that doesn't run to spec. Again, if you know it's not meeting the required functionality in
the spec, ask for help. But consider the level of your program's deficit. If it meets 98% of
the functional requirements, you will probably only get -2 or -3 for the missing aspects. So
you might not want to spend 3 late day fixing that, since 3 days late is -6 points. Use judgement.
